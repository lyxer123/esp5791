# ESP5791 Smart Contracts

Ready-to-deploy PBT contract based on [Chiru Labs' PBT implementation](https://github.com/chiru-labs/PBT) and
[OpenZeppelin's ERC721 NFT contracts](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts).

## Quickstart

- switch to `hardhat` directory: `cd hardhat`
- install dependencies: `yarn`
- copy `.env.example` to `.env` and put your own values in
- compile contracts: `yarn compile`
- TODO: deploy contracts (no script yet)
- TODO: seed chip addresses (no script yet)

## Interact with contract

- call `seedChipToTokenMapping(address[] chipAddresses, uint256[] tokenIds)` to link chips to token ids
- call `updateChips(address[] chipAddressesOld, address[] chipAddressesNew)` to "replace" defective chips
- call `getTokenData(address chipAddress)` to get data about a chip/token mapping
- call `transferTokenWithChip(bytes signatureFromChip, uint256 blockNumberUsedInSig)` to transfer or mint a token with a
  chip signature

## Notes

Hardhat dev environment based on [PaulRBerg's Hardhat Template](https://github.com/paulrberg/hardhat-template), refer to
that repo's README for specific questions on how to use the tools.
