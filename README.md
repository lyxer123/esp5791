# ESP5791

Physical Backed Tokens ([EIP-5791](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5791)) for everyone using ESP32 and BLE

## Monorepo folder structure

- `Arduino` contains the microcontroller firmware and tweaked libraries to be used with Arduino IDE
- `hardhat` contains Solidity smart contracts implementing EIP-5791, based on the [PBT](https://github.com/chiru-labs/PBT) project

## _Make_ a PBT - the hardware side

### Requirements

- [Arduino IDE](https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide-v1) Desktop App
- [esptool.py](https://github.com/espressif/esptool)
- ESP32 Dev board + USB cable

### Arduino IDE: Setup

- Go to `Tools > Board > Boards Manager`, search for and install **esp32** board definitions
- Symlink or copy libraries and sketch from the repo to the Arduino sketch folder

```bash
# example for symlinking on macOS
ln -s ~/path_to_repo/esp5791/Arduino/libraries/Web3E ~/Documents/Arduino/libraries/Web3E
ln -s ~/path_to_repo/esp5791/Arduino/libraries/NimBLE-Arduino ~/Documents/Arduino/libraries/NimBLE-Arduino
ln -s ~/path_to_repo/esp5791/Arduino/ESP5791 ~/Documents/Arduino/ESP5791
```

(Please use the libs included in the repo. You can find the original libs here for reference: [Web3E](https://github.com/AlphaWallet/Web3E) / [NimBLE](https://github.com/h2zero/NimBLE-Arduino])

### Arduino IDE: Flash firmware

- Connect ESP32 Dev board, choose correct settings in `Tools > Board` and `Tools > Port` for your setup
- Click _Upload_ to compile and flash the firmware
  - Depending on your ESP32 board, you may have to hold down the _boot_ button while flashing or you'll get an error
- On first boot, the ESP32 securely generates a random private key itself, and stores it in flash memory

### esptool.py: encrypt and secure chip using eFuses

!! Danger zone: this may brick your device !! changes done here are not reversible, thread carefully !!

- Read [ESP32 eFuse basics](https://blog.espressif.com/understanding-esp32s-security-features-14483e465724) first
- Enable [Flash encryption](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/security/flash-encryption.html).
  - For ESP32v3 chips and newer, also disable [UART ROM download mode](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/security/flash-encryption.html#enabling-uart-bootloader-encryption-decryption) here permanently
  - Be aware of the differences between _Development_ vs. _Release_ modes or you may brick your board
- Enable [Secure Boot V2](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/security/secure-boot-v2.html) (or [V1](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/security/secure-boot-v1.html) on older chips). This also disables JTAG access

## _Deploy_ your PBT - the smart contract

See the README in the `hardhat` directory.
